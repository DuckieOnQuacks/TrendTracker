# Social networking sites such as TikTok are vital channels for the diffusion of information across the internet. Understanding which factors drive content to become viral is of key interest in the fields of marketing, entertainment, and public outreach. In this paper, we investigate the role of hashtags as potential indicators of post popularity. We collected like count, follower count, timestamp, and hashtag data from 1867 unique TikTok videos. Through k-nearest neighbors clustering (KNN) and a decision tree classifier (DT), our analysis shows that hashtag use has no significant impact on a post's popularity or reach. We report prediction metrics for both models and discuss potential improvements for effective prediction of viral content.
