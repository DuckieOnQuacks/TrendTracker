CS 791 - TikTok Tracker Project
üåü About the Project
Welcome to the TikTok Tracker project repository! This initiative is part of Dr. Emily Hand's CS 791 Interdisciplinary Data Science Course for Spring 2024. Team members Lauren Feldman, Joey Paschke, and Ryan Baldwin dive deep into TikTok video data to uncover patterns that could predict trending content.

TikTok serves as a crucial platform for the spread of information. In this project, we focus on understanding how hashtags may influence the virality of posts. By analyzing data from 1,867 unique TikTok videos, including metrics like like counts, follower counts, timestamps, and hashtag usage, we strive to determine the impact of these elements on content popularity.

üöÄ Project Insights
Through our investigation using k-nearest neighbors clustering (KNN) and a decision tree classifier (DT), we discovered that hashtag usage does not significantly influence the popularity or reach of a post. This README covers our approach, findings, and discusses ways to refine our prediction models.

Key Features:
Analysis of 1,867 TikTok videos
Utilization of KNN and DT algorithms for trend prediction
Exploration of hashtag impact on video popularity
üìà Models and Metrics
We employed two main predictive models:

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN): For clustering based on similarity measures.
Decision Tree Classifier (DT): To classify data into categories based on learned decision rules.
The effectiveness of these models was assessed through various metrics, which are detailed within our project documentation.
